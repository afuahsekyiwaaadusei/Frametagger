## Repository Structure

### 1. Extension Folder
The **Extension** folder contains the complete code for the Chrome extension. It includes the logic to add functionality to the YouTube player and the UI for user interaction.

#### Folder Breakdown:
- **public/**
  - This folder contains core scripts that handle interaction with the YouTube video player.
  - **Key File**: 
    - `updateContent.js`: This file is responsible for adding features such as buttons to the YouTube toolbar. For example, the screenshot button is added here, and it also handles functions related to capturing and editing screenshots.

- **src/**
  - This folder contains the main user interface for the Chrome extension window.
  - Inside this folder, you'll find all the components necessary to build the popup window of the extension.
  - **Key Features**:
    - If you want to **update the UI** of the extension or **add new features** like searching for saved videos, you will need to work in this folder.
    - Here, you can modify components, create new UI elements, and add features to enhance user interaction with saved content.

### 2. Website Folder
The **Website** folder contains the code for the FrameTagger website, built using the **Next.js** framework. The website is designed to offer users information about the FrameTagger extension, including how to use it, its features, and other related content.

## Key Files and Their Responsibilities

1. **updateContent.js** (Located in `Extension/public/`):
   - Responsible for adding content to the YouTube window, such as:
     - Adding buttons to the YouTube toolbar.
     - Handling interactions like taking screenshots and opening the drawing panel.
   - **Example**: To add a new button for a feature like opening the edit panel, you would need to create a function here similar to the one used for adding the screenshot button.

2. **UI Components** (Located in `Extension/src/`):
   - Responsible for the user interface of the extension window.
   - If you need to update or extend the features, like **searching saved videos**, this is the folder to work in.
   - You can create new components or modify existing ones to add functionality to the extension's popup UI.
